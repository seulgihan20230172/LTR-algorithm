1. *Classify the Image*:
   - Informative: This includes images like screenshots, charts, diagrams, lists, tables, or any content that provides valuable, specific information relevant to the CTI content (e.g., technical data, attack details).
   - Non-Informative: This includes images that serve an aesthetic purpose, advertising, visual metaphors/abstractions, or do not add detailed, technical value to the CTI content (e.g., decorative art, photos of people, generic symbols).
2. *Description*: Provide a textual description of the image, summarizing what is depicted in the image.'''
